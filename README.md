### Kohlby V., Andrew W., Elliott L.

This is the repository containing a semester project for CS372 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks

# Installing Dev Dependencies

To Ensure you have all dependencies properly installed run `npm install`

# Linting with ESLint

To run ESLint on all files use command `npx eslint`

To run ESLint on specific files use `npx eslint <file>`

# Formatting with Prettier

To format all files in the project run `npx prettier --write .`

- Be careful, this will overwrite files so if you run this with unsaved changes things might get wacky

To format a single file run `npx prettier --write <file/dir>`
